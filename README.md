# Faceboo-UI-Clone
A clone of the facebook user interface to better understand the basics of web design and web design principles
make sure you open the index.html using live-server.
Why should I open using a live-server???
The icons used in the UI clone are svgs, they are not fontawesome icons, for svg icons to be visible, you must open the html file where the svgs are being rendered 
using a server, otherwise, they will not be visible.
